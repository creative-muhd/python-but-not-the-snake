### Open for changes:
We are all learning, no one is perfect.

### Recommendations
This is just a little highlight, if you want to learn the real aspects of Python i would recommend

1. W3schools
2. FreeCodeCamp
3. Youtube

They are many out there but as a beginner stick with these 3, or maybe get out of your comfort zone a little bit.
